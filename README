X11-FOCUS

Focus an X client window by number

DESCRIPTION

This is a small utility to focus a specific X window.  It is useful
for window managers which do not provide such built-in functionality.
It was originally intended for use with Openbox but it should work
with any window manager.

INSTALLATION

Compile and install the resulting executable:

  gcc -Wall -pedantic -o xfocus irssi-focus.c -lX11\
      `pkg-config --cflags --libs glib-2.0` -O2 -fno-strict-aliasing

  mv xfocus ~/bin

If you are using Openbox, define the appropriate keybindings:

  <keybind key="W-1">
    <action name="execute">
      <execute>xfocus 0</execute>
    </action>
  </keybind>
  <keybind key="W-2">
    <action name="execute">
      <execute>xfocus 1</execute>
    </action>
  </keybind>

And so on.
