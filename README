XFOCUS

Focus an X client window

SYNOPSIS

    xfocus window_number

DESCRIPTION

Xfocus is a small utility which focuses an X window by referring to
its number within an ordered list.  Window numbering begins at 0 and
proceeds in top-down order.  Windows with equal vertical position are
ordered from left to right.  A window's position is considered to be
its top-left corner, excluding any window decorations drawn by the
window manager.

This program is useful for window managers which do not provide such
built-in functionality.  It was originally intended for use with
Openbox but it should work with any window manager.

INSTALLATION

Compile and install the resulting executable:

    make
    make install

The "make install" command will install the binary under $HOME/bin.

If you are using Openbox, define the appropriate keybindings:

    <keybind key="W-1">
      <action name="execute">
        <execute>xfocus 0</execute>
      </action>
    </keybind>
    <keybind key="W-2">
      <action name="execute">
        <execute>xfocus 1</execute>
      </action>
    </keybind>

And so on.
