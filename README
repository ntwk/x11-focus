XFOCUS

Focus an X client window

SYNOPSIS

    xfocus window_number

DESCRIPTION

xfocus focuses an X window.  A target window is referenced by number
based on its relative position.  The top-left window is assigned
window_number 0.  Window numbering proceeds in top-down order,
including any unmapped windows.  Windows of equal vertical position
are numbered from left to right.  A window's position is considered to
be its top-left corner, excluding any window decorations drawn by the
window manager.

xfocus is useful for window managers without a similar built-in
functionality.  It was originally intended for use with Openbox but
should also work with any window manager.

INSTALLATION

Compile and install the resulting executable:

    make
    make install

The "make install" command will install the binary under $HOME/bin.

If you are using Openbox, define the appropriate keybindings:

    <keybind key="W-1">
      <action name="execute">
        <execute>xfocus 0</execute>
      </action>
    </keybind>
    <keybind key="W-2">
      <action name="execute">
        <execute>xfocus 1</execute>
      </action>
    </keybind>

And so on.
